NoteExporter
============

An OmniOutliner export plugin.


NoteExporter takes all note fields out of the OmniOutliner document and exports them to a plain text document.


You can download the Xcode project and build from there or get a copy of the plugin itself from the [releases page](https://github.com/dcwalker/NoteExporter/releases).
